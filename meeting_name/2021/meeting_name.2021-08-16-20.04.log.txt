20:05:33 <ariard> t-bast: yeah and i've discussed with other coredev orgas and they're okay to distribute more LN-invits :)
20:05:43 <BlueMatt> valwal: you gots to startmeeting
20:05:43 <BlueMatt> with the #s
20:05:54 <niftynei> she did! lol
20:06:02 <niftynei> i think we're on topic "warnings"
20:06:15 <BlueMatt> I left a number of comments on the pr
20:06:21 <BlueMatt> so waiting on those to be responded to
20:06:32 <BlueMatt> t-bast: commented as well, and i think we agreed on some proposed changes
20:06:32 <t-bast> Sounds like rusty needs to rebase and address comments
20:06:35 <BlueMatt> further, the pr needs to be rebased
20:06:40 <t-bast> But generally it's a concept ACK, right?
20:06:44 <BlueMatt> so i think its basically a "waiting on rusty to respond" thing
20:06:55 <valwal> ok
