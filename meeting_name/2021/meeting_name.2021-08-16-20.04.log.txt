20:05:33 <ariard> t-bast: yeah and i've discussed with other coredev orgas and they're okay to distribute more LN-invits :)
20:05:43 <BlueMatt> valwal: you gots to startmeeting
20:05:43 <BlueMatt> with the #s
20:05:54 <niftynei> she did! lol
20:06:02 <niftynei> i think we're on topic "warnings"
20:06:15 <BlueMatt> I left a number of comments on the pr
20:06:21 <BlueMatt> so waiting on those to be responded to
20:06:32 <BlueMatt> t-bast: commented as well, and i think we agreed on some proposed changes
20:06:32 <t-bast> Sounds like rusty needs to rebase and address comments
20:06:35 <BlueMatt> further, the pr needs to be rebased
20:06:40 <t-bast> But generally it's a concept ACK, right?
20:06:44 <BlueMatt> so i think its basically a "waiting on rusty to respond" thing
20:06:55 <valwal> ok
20:07:04 <valwal> #topic channel_type s
20:07:12 * rusty wakes up
20:07:27 <valwal> oh hey rusty!
20:07:33 <t-bast> hey rusty!
20:07:49 <BlueMatt> yea, def concept ack here, iirc lnd even has a pr to implement it
20:08:07 <rusty> OK, I will respond on PR.  I basically plastered advice over everywhere we said you MUST erorr, wherever it was theoretically psosible to recover, said you MAY send warning.
20:08:25 <rusty> (You can still send error!  And if you've closed, of course you should)
