20:07:38 <lndev-bot> The meeting name has been set to 'ln_marketing_committee'
20:07:40 <t-bast> Please diverge from the item order in the issue!
20:11:41 <ariard> mschmoock: iiuc it's either #911 or #917 ?
20:11:42 <BlueMatt> I'm game for either. networking is hard, lots of issues with any option.
20:12:00 <mschmoock> well, lot of back and forth. I think 917 is better
20:12:00 <BlueMatt> honestly could do both, but at least 917 is probably a better first-pass imo if only because it means less setup on the admin end
20:12:27 <t-bast> I'd slightly prefer avoiding using DNS explicitly, so #917 for me, but I don't have a strong NACK on #911 though
20:12:29 <BlueMatt> t-bast: had said concept ack on 917 and said he was gonna start coding :)
20:12:39 <mschmoock> is there any usage of #917 when using IPv6 addresses ? Is there something like IPv6 NAT??
20:12:53 <BlueMatt> mschmoock: yes, there is address mapping in v6
20:13:01 <BlueMatt> so i think it may be useful for v6 as well
20:13:06 <mschmoock> good
20:13:07 <BlueMatt> its probably also useful for tor
20:13:23 <BlueMatt> though somewhat less so
20:13:26 <t-bast> Can you detail why it's useful for tor?
20:14:09 <t-bast> To check the bridges used (bridge isn't the right term, is it)?
20:14:13 <BlueMatt> just means a node can auto-discover its addresses with zero configuration. eg if you configure tor but forget to configure your ln node, and then tell someone to connect to you on tor, *boom* your ln node is now configured
20:14:25 <BlueMatt> which seems nifty, but, indeed, isnt exactly a headline features
20:14:42 <t-bast> Oh ok, so you'd really put the onion address in there
20:15:11 <BlueMatt> yea, just putting "I think I'm connecting to 10.X" isnt exactly useful :)
20:15:51 <cdecker[m]> Or Tor will return 127.0.0.1 always :-)
20:16:01 <BlueMatt> right or that
20:16:01 <mschmoock> Okay, when we discover some new address supposedly of our node, whats the best strategy to use that? BlueMatt mentioned just to broadcast 'all' (maybe upt to a limit)
20:16:18 <cdecker[m]> So needs to filter local addrs
20:16:20 <BlueMatt> yea, i dunno, doesn't need to be in the spec imo.
20:16:29 <BlueMatt> just "dont include local addresses" could be mentioned
20:16:48 <BlueMatt> but nodes can figure out for themselves how they want to use the addresses provided, including them all is cool, trying to filter is cool too.
