I'm looking to deploy it on a server such that it autorestarts if the server goes down.  Normally I'd use something like supervisord for something like this.  However, it looks like each time lnd needs to start up, someone has to run the lncli unlock command.Â  My understanding is that your lightning node needs to always be up, so I was</span></span>

(Thats as precicely as I understand it, just so you can gague my level of understanding ;-)</span></span>

He goes on with his node life and after a week Alice broadcast the funding tx with Bob's still-unspent UTxOs. She refuses to mutual close so he has to broadcast the first commitment transaction. That's a cost,</span></span>

Future LSPs, if they use lightning all the way (and one of the main implementations) probably won't need to hold HTLCs like that</span></span>
