20:06:22 <niftynei> two bots for the price of one, of this is exciting
20:06:50 <cdecker[m]> Hurray
20:07:09 <rusty> #topic https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/834
20:07:13 <cdecker[m]> Stopped one of them, I think it was trying to make up for last time
20:07:28 <niftynei> looks like  lndev-botimous prime has been chosen as the survivor lol ;)
20:08:14 <cdecker[m]> Shouldn't matter, logs and agenda will still work
20:08:35 <t-bast> Go #834, go! I think it's high time this gets merged, we've seen it being useful many times already in the real world (just found a c-lightning issue today thanks to it)
20:08:38 <rusty> OK, I can rebase this.  roasbeef mentioned wanting a feature bit, which in this case seems overkill (you can always still send an erorr)
20:08:40 <BlueMatt> I think the only thing left to resolve on warnings is https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/834#discussion_r702330608 ?
20:09:28 <BlueMatt> oh, wait, no, still need to resolve the removal of the all-0s error message
20:09:35 <BlueMatt> and whether we want to do that
20:10:51 <BlueMatt> thoughts?
20:10:53 <roasbeef> see my comment on that other PR: there was a new change that depended on this new warning message, but in that case how is the peer meant to even know to expect the warning message if there's no feature bit?
20:11:01 <roasbeef> I don't understand this new aversion to feature bits
20:11:13 <rusty> BlueMatt: yes, I believe you're the only one to support it, and I think you fail them one at a time as reestablish is sent,
20:11:14 <roasbeef> unless you always send the warning _and_ error in all scenarios?
20:11:17 <t-bast> I'm very neutral on whether we should keep all-0s error message or not, I don't mind either way
20:11:26 <BlueMatt> the peer cant "expect a warning message", warning messages are required to be "ignored"
20:11:31 <roasbeef> still as is, I don't really see what this PR does
20:11:37 <roasbeef> it's just the old error message w/ a new name
20:11:48 <rusty> BlueMatt: but if they don't set the feature, you can ignore errors more.
20:11:55 <BlueMatt> rusty: ok, let me rephrase, I think we should *add* an all-0s error message :)
