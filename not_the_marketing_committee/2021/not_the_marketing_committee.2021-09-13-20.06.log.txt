20:06:22 <niftynei> two bots for the price of one, of this is exciting
20:06:50 <cdecker[m]> Hurray
20:07:09 <rusty> #topic https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/834
20:07:13 <cdecker[m]> Stopped one of them, I think it was trying to make up for last time
20:07:28 <niftynei> looks like  lndev-botimous prime has been chosen as the survivor lol ;)
20:08:14 <cdecker[m]> Shouldn't matter, logs and agenda will still work
20:08:35 <t-bast> Go #834, go! I think it's high time this gets merged, we've seen it being useful many times already in the real world (just found a c-lightning issue today thanks to it)
20:08:38 <rusty> OK, I can rebase this.  roasbeef mentioned wanting a feature bit, which in this case seems overkill (you can always still send an erorr)
20:08:40 <BlueMatt> I think the only thing left to resolve on warnings is https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/834#discussion_r702330608 ?
20:09:28 <BlueMatt> oh, wait, no, still need to resolve the removal of the all-0s error message
20:09:35 <BlueMatt> and whether we want to do that
20:10:51 <BlueMatt> thoughts?
20:10:53 <roasbeef> see my comment on that other PR: there was a new change that depended on this new warning message, but in that case how is the peer meant to even know to expect the warning message if there's no feature bit?
20:11:01 <roasbeef> I don't understand this new aversion to feature bits
20:11:13 <rusty> BlueMatt: yes, I believe you're the only one to support it, and I think you fail them one at a time as reestablish is sent,
20:11:14 <roasbeef> unless you always send the warning _and_ error in all scenarios?
20:11:17 <t-bast> I'm very neutral on whether we should keep all-0s error message or not, I don't mind either way
20:11:26 <BlueMatt> the peer cant "expect a warning message", warning messages are required to be "ignored"
20:11:31 <roasbeef> still as is, I don't really see what this PR does
20:11:37 <roasbeef> it's just the old error message w/ a new name
20:11:48 <rusty> BlueMatt: but if they don't set the feature, you can ignore errors more.
20:11:55 <BlueMatt> rusty: ok, let me rephrase, I think we should *add* an all-0s error message :)
20:12:13 <t-bast> roasbeef: it's an odd message, they've been explicitly created to allow optional things that you don't need to support, there's really 0 reason to have a feature bit for warning messages
20:12:14 <rusty> BlueMatt: OK, I disagree.  It's another implementation details which won't be implemented.
20:12:27 <BlueMatt> why wouldn't you implement it?
20:12:38 <BlueMatt> that's a useful way to say "go away, close the channels, I'm not gonna talk to you anymore"
20:12:44 <BlueMatt> without having to have a reconnect loop
20:12:45 <roasbeef> comment re PR: https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/904#issuecomment-909815114
20:12:56 <rusty> BlueMatt: I haven't yet.  I never send such a thing, and I can't see why I would.
20:13:05 <t-bast> roasbeef: it helped a lot figure out many bugs in the wild already on our side, so I'd say it has already proven its worth as-is
20:13:06 <roasbeef> so rather than use the explicit feature bit dep system we built in, we now rely on implicit TLV deps?
20:13:17 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: I believe your comment there, really, is more about quick close feature bit, less about warning message feature bit
20:13:50 <rusty> I agree with roasbeef, we should use a feature bit.  And if set, that means errors are *errors*, are genuinely unrecoverable, and you should really drop to chain.
20:13:52 <roasbeef> BlueMatt: no it's about both, the quick close depends on the warning message the way it's written, and we have a natural way to indicate dependent protocol features: the feature bit deps
20:14:09 <niftynei> rusty: "close all channels" is probably more useful if there's more than one channel btw peers :P
20:14:12 <BlueMatt> rusty: ah, as a backwards compat for the implementations that always ignored errors?
20:14:17 <rusty> (And we can drop all our "wait, this is a spurious error, reconnec and try again" logic)
20:14:40 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: outside of the scope of quick close, is there ever a reason why you'd seek out a peer that will send warning messages?
20:14:41 <rusty> BlueMatt: yeah, e.g. LND used to send an error if you were too slow to handshake, and we used to close channels...
20:14:46 <t-bast> Agreed with BlueMatt, we can argue about whether quick close needs a feature bits, but warning messages are really optional messages you're free to ignore but that may help you diagnose issues in the wild, and that doesn't need a feature bit at all, that's why we split messages in odd vs even
20:14:52 <roasbeef> t-bast: bugs related to the warning message? or bugs in new feature that assume the warning message?
20:15:10 <BlueMatt> I do think rusty has a point here, though, I would be in favor of a feature bit that means "yes, errors are errors, follow the spec, stop ignoring them"
20:15:15 <t-bast> roasbeef: bugs in new and old features that now include warning messages which help us figure out what's wrong on the other side
20:15:25 <rusty> t-bast: I disagree, I'd really like to get rid of the cases where c-lightning ignores errors because implementations used to send them.
20:15:40 <roasbeef> t-bast: figruing it out is all manual tho right? given you have no way to programmatically handle the new message as it's just a string?
20:15:58 <BlueMatt> rusty: re: all-0s, I guess I'm still vaguely of the thinking that reconnect loops absolutely suck, and we should stop throwing our hands up and assuming they're ok.
20:16:00 <roasbeef> in which cases would the warning message help you uniquely dianose something that the existing error message would't?
20:16:25 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: yes, because unlike error messages, warning messages dont close the channel.
20:16:34 <t-bast> rusty: we still don't ignore errors and don't plan on starting to ignore them
20:16:58 <BlueMatt> t-bast: do y'all implement the all-0s close-all-channels error logic?
20:17:10 <rusty> t-bast: ouch, we had several cases we had to, to avoid forced closing.  Maybe safe to remove them now...
20:17:14 <roasbeef> BlueMatt: re why would seek them out, assuming it has error codes, then yeah as you're able to programtically handle certain denegrate cases, and also know that you have strucutred data in the errors
20:17:28 <t-bast> roasbeef: even manual, it's a net improvement compared to what we had before, that's the best argument I can have for a feature - it solves a problem we actually have, not a theoretical one
20:17:32 <roasbeef> but it's less about seeking them out, and making it explicit that two protocol features are dependent on each other
20:17:50 <roasbeef> this is the PR that adds that dep btw: https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/904
20:17:54 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: I'd understand if you added a feature bit for when warnings got a programatic handling support, but that's not what we're talking about here
20:18:02 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: the warning messages in this pr *MUST* be ignored
20:18:20 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: we can revisit the feature bit discussion when y'all add the "programatic why we warned" logic in the tlv
20:18:29 <t-bast> BlueMatt: we did have the close-all-channels on all-0s error, but we may have removed it recently, I'll need to check
20:18:42 <roasbeef> BlueMatt: which PR #904?
20:19:08 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: no, 834. 904 would again be a conversation about quick close feature bits, which seems separate from just warning messages?
20:19:09 <roasbeef> yeah we're moving forward w/ the TLVs on our end, likely just in the old error message though, given the warning message is identical
20:19:33 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: I mean error already has programatic handling assigned to it - close the channel.
20:19:36 <niftynei> but it's not identical
20:19:37 <roasbeef> must be ignored? totally confused
20:19:39 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: not sure what else you'd want to add?
20:20:06 <BlueMatt> the current warning message, because it has nothing but a string, must be ignored from a logic perspective. you can go log it, tell the user, whatever, but you can't *do* something
20:20:09 <roasbeef> the close channel clause is essentially deprecated, no one does it
20:20:13 <t-bast> rusty: yeah I think nowadays you shouldn't have too may issues re-activating the logic of force-closing when you receive an error, it's not biting us at all on our node
20:20:24 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: we do it, eclair does it, and c-lightning is planning on doing it, maybe with a feature bit
20:20:29 <BlueMatt> so, no, its not deprecated
20:20:51 <t-bast> rusty: it was an issue at some point and we've had unwanted channel closure, but it's gotten much better in the last 12 months to be honest
20:21:10 <BlueMatt> I've *never* seen an unwanted channel closure as the result of an error message, fwiw :)
20:21:24 <roasbeef> it's ill advised imo, which is why it never really caught on
20:22:06 <rusty> roasbeef: wait, t-bast just said they're force-closing on all errors.  I double-checked c-lightning, we gave up and are ignoring all errors :(  We reconnect though
20:22:07 <t-bast> BlueMatt: you arrived on mainnet at the right time, after the nastyness happened xD
20:22:15 <BlueMatt> t-bast: I'm aware
20:22:27 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: its ill advised to tell your peer that you're broadcasting the local state? that just seems like an incredibly helpful and nice thing to do.
20:22:32 <roasbeef> rusty: so then just eclair force closes?
20:22:47 <t-bast> roasbeef: yes, when we receive an error we do
20:22:48 <roasbeef> BlueMatt: you can do that w/ an error message, but doesn't mean they need to force close
20:22:49 <rusty> roasbeef: and LDK it seems.
20:23:28 <roasbeef> say "I broadcasted btw, it's in the mempool" is totally useful, but rn we don't have a way to allow nodes to properly handle that, since it's just a string
20:23:32 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: sure, I mean they dont have to broadcast, but its a really great way to say "dont try to route over this again, dont expect me to accept anything, you should give up on this channel"
20:23:45 <roasbeef> lnd doesn't watch the mempool though, so we'll only note that once it hits the chain
20:24:02 <roasbeef> yeh that sounds useful, but we don't have a way to do that atm w/ just the string
20:24:03 <BlueMatt> yes, we do have a way to tell a node that, the error message!
20:24:22 <BlueMatt> sending an error message with a channel_id set is *exactly* that, according to the spec, and the way eclair and LDK have implemented it
20:24:33 <BlueMatt> I understand historically that was not practical, but those nodes hardly exist anymore.
20:24:37 <rusty> I think warning is still useful, as there are cases which are recoverable (esp since reconnection does reset some state).
20:24:58 <BlueMatt> now, as an alternative to the current warning message pr, we *could* swap the message types
20:25:02 <rusty> But yes, you have to avoid looping too hard.
20:25:12 <BlueMatt> ie define a new "warning" message, with the type of current error, and then add a *new* error message
20:25:34 <BlueMatt> the new error message would have the semantics of error as-define, but not lnd/c-ln implemented.
20:26:18 <niftynei> do the msg type support that?
20:26:24 <BlueMatt> hmm?
20:26:35 <niftynei> isn't error msg a mandatory msg bit
20:26:50 <BlueMatt> probably, but its not like there are any implementations that *dont* understand it
20:27:03 <BlueMatt> like, yes, we'll redefine it to "you must understand how to deserialize this, but also you must then ignore it"
20:27:04 <niftynei> ah no it's 17
20:27:08 <BlueMatt> oh, even better
20:27:27 <niftynei> that sucks though from an implementation/upgrade standpoint
20:27:47 <BlueMatt> it does
20:28:00 <BlueMatt> but i suggested it as roasbeef seemed insistent on error messages being ignored going forward
20:28:05 <BlueMatt> but now roasbeef stopped responding :/
20:28:15 <rusty> That seems like a backward step.  Here are a short list of where we currently send a warning (and reconnect):
20:28:16 <niftynei> like .. sometimes warning messages are fatal and other times they aren't, depending on what version of CL you're talking to? idk
20:28:18 <roasbeef> no not that they should be ignored
20:28:24 <t-bast> to be fair, I get the feeling that roasbeef you're completely dismissing this PR on principle because you'd like something else (error codes automated *some* scenarios), which feels to me very orthogonal and can be done separately
20:28:36 <roasbeef> they're useful, we've used them to debug invalid sig issues in the past
20:29:03 <roasbeef> no I'm not, I'm just saying I don't find it useful really as is, and we prob won't implement it, ofc ppl can deploy it or w/e
20:29:23 <roasbeef> we're following thru w/ our error codes thing, since it solves a buncha problems for us
20:29:27 <niftynei> but your reason for finding it "unuseful" is that ... you've never enforced the semantics of errors meaning "close the channel"??
20:29:39 <roasbeef> maybe we'll bLIP it, since everyone doesn't think error codes are useful
20:29:54 <t-bast> it's already been useful for us many times in the wild, and feels like a net improvement that requires like 20 lines of code, so I'd really like to see it happen...
20:30:04 <niftynei> i mean honestly, it sounds like LND is in favor of upgrading all their error messages to warnings?
20:30:19 <niftynei> to match your current behavior to the spec
20:30:21 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: sheesh, no one is saying error codes are *not* useful
20:30:28 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: please stop putting words in others' mouths
20:30:32 <roasbeef> sure, seems you've already implemented it, but the lingering question re the dep w/ it and the quick close thing stands: if nodes don't impl warning, they can't do quick close or the other way around?
20:30:37 <rusty> - various experimental things (malformed STFU message, etc).
20:30:37 <rusty> - short_id mismatch in announcement_signatures
20:30:37 <rusty> - almost any malformed message (e.g. update_htlc which we can't decode)
20:30:37 <rusty> - unable to add htlc for any reason
20:30:37 <rusty> - update_fee from non-opener
20:30:38 <rusty> - update_fee unreasonable
20:30:39 <t-bast> I'm interested in the error codes as well, and would love to see a PR for that, but it feels completely additive to warnings to me, if we have both I'd be very happy
20:30:43 <roasbeef> idk that was said pretty plainly in #834
20:30:50 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: people have given you *feedback* on error codes, and suggested its a great thing to add as a tlv in a warning message, adding new logic to how you have to handle them
20:31:20 <roasbeef> maybe we should move onto something else?
20:31:24 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: and also said that warnings are useful on their own, and error codes are a nice extension, thus we should move forward with warnings then add stuff on top
20:31:27 <roasbeef> this has taken up a lot of time
20:31:28 <t-bast> roasbeef: of course they can do quick close without it, and that's a completely separate discussion...?
20:31:38 <BlueMatt> I'm not really sure how you have so misinterpreted the feedback given there.
20:31:45 <roasbeef> t-bast: but then #904 would need to be modified right? since it says send a warning if the quick close fails?
20:32:04 <t-bast> roasbeef: no, it's just that it's *nicer* with a warning, it's a small improvement
20:32:20 <BlueMatt> roasbeef: did you see my comment at https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/904#issuecomment-911982144 ?
20:32:20 <t-bast> roasbeef: doesn't *require* it at all
20:32:25 <BlueMatt> I tried to explain it a bit more verbosely
